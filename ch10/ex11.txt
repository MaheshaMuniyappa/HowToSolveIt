1.  Make a text field that takes a password.  The text
field accepts only characters.  The moment any digit is
typed, show an error in the status bar and don't accept
the digit typed.

2.  Make  3 scroll bars in an applet representing red,
green and blue colors.  The ranges of scroll bars are
0 to 255.  As the scroll bars are moved, mix all three
color values to set a mixture color and change the
background color of the applet to mixture color.

3.  Make a calculator application using frame.
